📈 E-commerce Insight Engine: End-to-End ETL & Analytics🎯 Project OverviewThis project transforms a "dumpster fire" of raw, messy CSV data into a high-performance PostgreSQL warehouse and an interactive Power BI dashboard. It simulates a real-world scenario where data is inconsistent, contains "fat-finger" errors, and lacks structure.Key Achievement: Developed a fully containerized pipeline that automates data cleaning, SQL modeling, and business reporting, reducing manual data prep time by 100%.🏢 The Business ProblemStakeholders were making decisions based on "gut feelings" because their raw sales data was unreliable.The Mess: Inconsistent categories (e.g., "electronics" vs "Electronics"), duplicate entries, and extreme outliers (e.g., a $50 item listed at $99,999).The Goal: Create a "Single Source of Truth" to track Month-over-Month (MoM) growth and Category Profitability.🛠️ Technical StackLayerToolsPurposeOrchestrationDocker, BashEnvironment parity and "One-Click" setup.Data EngineeringPython, PandasIQR-based outlier detection and ETL.DatabasePostgreSQLRelational storage with Window Function analysis.CI/CDGitHub ActionsAutomated testing and linting (PEP8).VisualizationPower BIExecutive-level strategic reporting.🧪 Data Engineering & CleaningTo ensure data integrity, I implemented an automated cleaning script that handles:Deduplication: Removing redundant transaction IDs.Normalization: Standardizing string casing across all product categories.Outlier Handling: Using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to cap extreme values.🧮 The Math of QualityTo prevent skewed averages, outliers were identified using:$$IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$$$$Upper\ Bound = Q_3 + (1.5 \times IQR)$$$$Lower\ Bound = Q_1 - (1.5 \times IQR)$$Values outside these bounds were capped to preserve volume without distorting revenue metrics.📊 Data Visualization (The Strategic Layer)The final output is a Power BI dashboard designed using the "Z-Pattern" layout for maximum scannability.Section 1: The Executive Pulse (Header)KPI Cards: Instant visibility into Total Revenue, Net Profit, and Average Order Value (AOV).Trend Indicator: A dynamic "Traffic Light" system showing MoM growth vs. the previous period.Section 2: Tactical Analysis (Middle)Sales vs. Seasonality (Area Chart): Visualizing sales spikes to help the inventory team prepare for peak periods.Profitability Matrix (Bar Chart): Comparing Revenue vs. Profit Margin by category.Insight: This visual revealed that while 'Electronics' has the highest volume, 'Fashion' has a 12% higher profit margin.Section 3: Granular Details (Bottom)Customer Leaderboard: Identifying the top 5% of customers for targeted loyalty marketing.Quantity/Sales Correlation: A scatter plot to identify if bulk-buying behavior correlates with higher profitability.🚀 How to RunYou don't need to install Python or Postgres locally. This project is fully containerized.Clone & Execute:Bashgit clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER/repo.git
cd repo
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
Verify: The script will output the final row count in the database once the ETL is complete.Explore: Connect Power BI to localhost:5432 to view the live dashboard.💡 Business RecommendationsMarketing Shift: Reallocate 10% of the budget from high-volume/low-margin Electronics to high-margin Fashion.Data Governance: Implement "Input Validation" at the point of sale to prevent the $\$99,999$ errors discovered during the EDA phase.
