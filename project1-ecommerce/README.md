# 📈 E-commerce Insight Engine: End-to-End ETL & Analytics
![CI Status](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ecommerce-sales-analysis/actions/workflows/p1-ci.yml/badge.svg)

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project delivers a production-grade **end-to-end data pipeline** designed to transform raw, fragmented e-commerce transaction data into actionable business intelligence. By automating the extraction, cleaning, and loading processes, I established a "Single Source of Truth" that identifies revenue leaks and growth opportunities.

**Key Achievement:** Developed a containerized architecture that handles data ingestion, IQR-based outlier detection, and SQL-based performance modeling with 100% automation.

## 🏢 The Business Problem
The executive team struggled with inconsistent reporting due to "dirty" raw data. Key issues included:
* **Data Integrity:** Redundant entries and inconsistent category naming (e.g., "electronics" vs. "Electronics").
* **Skewed Metrics:** Extreme "fat-finger" outliers (e.g., a single order for \$99,999) distorting average sales figures.
* **Lack of Visibility:** No centralized way to track Month-over-Month (MoM) growth or category-specific profit margins.
