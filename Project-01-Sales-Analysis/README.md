# Project 01 E-commerce Sales Analysis

## Goal: Identify $150K in "lost" profit by analyzing underperforming product categories and calculating Year-over-Year (YoY) growth trends across 1,000+ orders.

### The Business Problem:
* The executive team observed a stagnation in revenue despite higher marketing spend. This project identifies which categories are dragging down margins and who the highest-value customers are to help reallocate the Q4 budget effectively.

### Tech Stack:
* Python (Pandas/NumPy): For Data cleaning.
* SQL (PostgreSQL): For more advanced analysis.
* Power BI: For data visualization.
* Codespaces with Jupyter Notebooks: Best environment for experimentation and data exploration.
